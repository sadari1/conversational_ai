# conversational_ai
An experiment in creating a true conversational AI that isn't just another scripted chatbot. 

# Current work

Currently, work is being done in attempting to parse the twitter customer service data and train a rudimentary text generator from scratch as a starting point.

Near-future work includes plans for training a sentiment analysis model as well as an intent classification model to help process data before training the final text generation
model that takes as input a combination of sentiment, intent, and the feature vector representing the text.
